# DApps

This folder contains DApps utilizing ZK proofs.

It is the top level of ZKP verification by calling the [mid level verifier wrapper](../verifierWrappers/README.md). After successful verification the DApp usually issues a verification SBT and unlocks the business logic of the DApp for the user.
