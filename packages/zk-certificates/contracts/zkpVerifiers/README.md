# ZKP Verifiers

This folder contains low level zero-knowledge proof verifiers. They are autogenerated by building the circom circuits using the smartCircuitBuild task.
These verifer smart contracts only check the integrety of the ZKP in itself. It does not check consistency of public inputs with the on-chain state.
